# Software Page Refactoring

## Overview
The software page has been refactored to separate data and UI components for better maintainability, reusability, and code organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Separation
- **Created**: `src/data/softwareData.ts`
  - Contains all static data including content, experience, projects, and helper functions
  - Defines TypeScript interfaces for type safety
  - Exports functions to get language-specific data

### 2. UI Components
Created reusable components in `src/components/software/`:

- **MatrixBackground.tsx**: Matrix rain effect and background animations
- **HeroSection.tsx**: Main hero section with title and description
- **KeyAchievements.tsx**: Key metrics and achievements display
- **CoreExpertise.tsx**: Core expertise cards with technologies
- **ExperienceSection.tsx**: Professional experience timeline
- **FeaturedProjects.tsx**: Featured projects grid
- **ContactSection.tsx**: Contact call-to-action section
- **SoftwareStyles.tsx**: CSS animations and keyframes

### 3. Main Page Refactoring
- **Simplified**: `src/app/software/page.tsx`
  - Now only handles state management and component composition
  - Imports data from `softwareData.ts`
  - Uses reusable UI components
  - Much cleaner and more maintainable

## Benefits

### Maintainability
- Data changes only require updates to `softwareData.ts`
- UI changes are isolated to specific components
- Easier to test individual components

### Reusability
- Components can be reused in other pages
- Data can be imported and used elsewhere
- Consistent styling and behavior across components

### Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better file structure
- Easier to navigate and understand

### Type Safety
- TypeScript interfaces ensure data consistency
- Better IDE support and error catching
- Self-documenting code

## File Structure
```
src/
├── app/
│   └── software/
│       └── page.tsx (refactored main page)
├── components/
│   └── software/
│       ├── MatrixBackground.tsx
│       ├── HeroSection.tsx
│       ├── KeyAchievements.tsx
│       ├── CoreExpertise.tsx
│       ├── ExperienceSection.tsx
│       ├── FeaturedProjects.tsx
│       ├── ContactSection.tsx
│       └── SoftwareStyles.tsx
└── data/
    └── softwareData.ts (all data and interfaces)
```

## Usage
The refactored page maintains the same functionality while being much more organized. All animations, styling, and interactions remain the same, but the code is now modular and maintainable.
